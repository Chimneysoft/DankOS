# DankOS
A really simple Real Mode OS, in honour of youtuber Druaga1. http://dankos.org

# Building requirements
Currently, there is no Windows make script, so this only builds on GNU/Linux
and FreeBSD systems.

In order to successfully build the OS, these packages should be installed:

- bash (to run the make_me script)
- nasm

# Building instructions
The 'make_me.sh' bash script automatically builds the image, and assembles all
the sources from the 'sources' directory.

All files/dirs from the 'extra' directory will also be copied onto the image.
